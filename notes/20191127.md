# Problems and assumptions in Discrete-Log-type cryptography

## DLP (Discrete log problem)

```
Given Y := g^x
  x in Z_g
Compute x in Z_q
```

## CDHP (Computational DH Problem)

```
Given A := g^a, B := g^b
  a, b in Z_q
Compute C = g^(ab)
```

Weaker than DLP.

## DDHP (Decisional DH Problem)

```
Given A := g^a, B := g^b, C := g^(b ? ab : c), C' := g^c
  a, b, c in Z_q, b in {0,1}
Distinguish C and C'
```

## Theorem

DH KA protocol has KA security under the DDHP (hence also CDHP and DLP)
assumption

# 10 Public key cryptosystems

* Each user has a public/private keypair
* O(n) keys in network of n users. Compare symmetric cryptosystems: O(n^2) keys

## Definitions

Public key crypto scheme Sigma consist of:

```
M Message space
C cipher space
KeyGen() -> (pk, sk)
Enc(pk, m) -> c
Dec(sk, c) -> m'
```

## Completness

Forall m in M, forall (pk, sk): Dec(sk, Enc(pk, m)) = m


## Security against pk-CPA

Sigma has security against chosen-plaintext attacks (CPA) if following two
libraries indistinguishable:

```
L_PK-CPA-L:
  (pk, sk) <- Sigma.KeyGen()

  GETKEY():
    return pk

  TEST(m_l, m_r):
    return Enc(pk, m_l)

L_PK-CPA-R:
  (pk, sk) <- Sigma.KeyGen()

  GETKEY():
    return pk

  TEST(m_l, m_r):
    return Enc(pk, m_r)
```

As the attacker can encrypt messages of his own, encryption must be
non-deterministic once more.

## Pseudorandom ciphertext against pk-CPA

```
L_PK-CPA-Real:
  (pk, sk) <- Sigma.KeyGen()

  GETKEY():
    return pk

  CTXT(m):
    return Enc(pk, m)

L_PK-CPA-Rand:
  (pk, sk) <- Sigma.KeyGen()

  GETKEY():
    return pk

  CTXT(m):
    # c such that length correlated with length of m
    c <- Sigma.C
    return c
```

## Theorem

If Sigma has Pseudorandom Ciphertext (pk-cpa$-secure), it is also secure
against CPA (pk-cpa-secure)

## ElGamal cryptosystem

Public key cryptosystem based on DH algorithm.

```
# Multiplicative group
G = <g>
|G| = q

KeyGen():
  x <- Z_q
  Y := g^x
  return (Y, x)

Enc(Y, m):
  r <- Zq
  R := g^r
  C := m * Y
  return R, C

Dec(x, (R, C)):
  m' := C / R^x
  return m'
```

### Completness

```
Dec(x, Enc(Y, m))
= Dec(x, (R, C))
= Dec(x, (g^r, m * Y^r))
= m * Y^r / (g^r)^x
= m * g^(x*r) / g^(r*x)
= m
```

### Security

Consider giving only one ciphertext to the adversary from the library - that is
only one CTXT() call.

```
L_pk-CPA-OTS-$-real:
  x <- Z_q
  Y := g^x
  cnt := 0

  GETKEY():
    return Y

  CTXT(m):
    if cnt > 0:
      return nil
    cnt++

    r <- Z_q
    R := g^r
    C := m * Y^r

    return (R, C)

L_pk-CPA-OTS-$-rand:
  x <- Z_q
  Y := g^x
  cnt := 0

  GETKEY():
    return Y

  CTXT(m):
    if cnt > 0:
      return nil
    cnt++

    r <- Z_q
    c <- Z_q

    return (g^r, g^c)
```

Note: For real library adversary has `C := m * g^(x*r)` exposed. For random
library `C := g^(x*r)`.

Does not matter however, as m arbitrarily chosen, `g^(x*r)` uniformly, so
multiplication within group with uniform element simply produces another
uniform element, just as output of random library.

## Hashed ElGamal

Using a hash function `H: G -> {0, 1}^k` as a random oracle.

```
M = {0, 1}^k
C = G * {0, 1}^k

KeyGen()L
  x <- Z_q
  Y := g^x

Enc(Y, m):
  r <- Z_q
  R := g^r
  C := m XOR H(Y^r)
  return (R, C)

Dec(x, (R, C))
  h := H(R^x)
  return C XOR h
```

Corectness: `Y^r = g^(xr) = g^(rx)= R^x`

Hsah function is modelled as an idealized primitive, assumed to be available to
the algorithms, a random oracle.

This gives strong (but heuristic!) evidence that our scheme is secure.

### H in random oracle model (ROM)

```
T := []

H(x in {0, 1}^*):
  if T[x] = nil then
    T[x] <- {0, 1}^k
  return T[x]
```

Intuitively, the output of such a hash function looks uniformly random as in
this model, even though in reality it is obviously not.

Full story in Katz-Lindell book, 11.4.3.

Hashed ElGamal is secure under CDHA in the Random-Oracle model (ROM).
