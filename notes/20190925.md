# Provable security

## Information-theoretically secure vs computationally secure

- OTP:
  - Not practical
  - Information-theoretically secure (as opposed to computationally secure)
    - No matter how much computation power adversary has, no information gained
      (eg exactly one key such that enc(m) = c)
  - Illustrative

- Pratical cryptosystems are computationally secure
  - All the information is there, but adversary lacks time to derive information about plaintext

## Formalization of encryption

### Syntax

- Three algorithms: KeyGen, Encryption, Decryption

Def: Symmetric cryptosystem Sigma:
  KeyGen() -> k, randomized, k in K
  Enc(k, m) -> c, m in M, c in C, can be randomized
  Dec(k, c) -> m, usually deterministic

  SIgma = (Sigma.KeyGen, Sigma.Enc, Sigma.Dec), Sigma.K, Sigma.M, Sigma.C)

### Correctness

Cryptosystem does not destroy information, if used honestly / correctly.

Def:

Cryptosystem Sigma is correct IFF:
  forall k in K, forall m in M: P[Dec(k, Env(k, m)) = m] = 1

P = 1 important as things in cryptography generally happen with a chance of
"almost 1", eg attacker not guessing the key

#### Example

Enc(k, m) = m
Dec(k, c) = c

Correct, but totally insecure

### Excursion: Terminology in distributed systems

Liveness: "Something good eventually happens" => Corresponds to correctness
Safety: "Nothing bad has happened" => Corresponds to security

### Security

Eavesdrop() experiment from OTP, but was too specific. More generally:

#### Candidate sec def A (attempt 2 in script)

Sigma is secure if, forall m in M, the output of Eavesdrop(m) is uniformally
distributed over C.

```
Eavesdrop(m in M):
  k := KeyGen()
  c := Enc(k, m)
  return c

```

#### Candidate B (attempt 3)

Sigma is secure if, forall m in M, the following two functions produce the same
random variable.

```
# Equal to candidate A, "real" distribution
Eavesdrop(m):
  k := KeyGen()
  c := Enc(k, m)
  return c

# "Fake" or "ideal" distribution
Eavesdrop(m):
  c := C # Uniform random pick from c
  return c
```

Candidate B uses indistinguishability or distributions as criterium. Candidate
C introduces an adversary who attempts to distinguish the two.

#### Candidate C (attempt 4)

Experiments as per candidate B.
An adversary A (distinguishing algorithm) attempts to find out which experiment
an output is from. Outputs 0/1 depending on where it thinks the experiment it's from.

P[A with B-Upper -> 1] = P[A with B-Lower -> 1]

Sigma is secure if, forall algorithms A, running A with upper or lower
experiment of candidate B, output 1 is equally likely.

How secure and useful are these?
K = M = {0, 1}^lambda
Enc(k, m) = m XOR k  . m XOR k  # . = string concatenation
Dec(k, c) = c1 . c2 := c # Split c into two halfs
            return c1 XOR k

In most cases you can tell which distribution it's from, as B-Upper will
produce two repeating strings always, B-Lower rarely. But it's just as secure
as OTP (merely ciphertext repeated twice)

Hence candidate C is too strong.

#### Candidate D

Sigma is secure is for all alg A, forall m1, m2 in M, running with upper or
lower implementation of Eavesdrop, A outputs 1 with equal probability.

```
Eavesdrop(m1, m2):
  k := KeyGen()
  c := Enc(k, m1)
  return c

Eavesdrop(m1, m2):
  k := KeyGen()
  c := Enc(k, m2)
  return c
```

Later: Adversary gets to choose m1, m2 -> Chosen-Plaintext security / attack

### Defining provable security

#### Def: Library

Library L is a collection of functions and static variables / shared state. Its
interface are its functions, their arguments, and types.

#### Def: Composition operator

Running a program P with (linked to) library L is denoted by P x L  # Notation:
x = "diamond" shape

Eg: P x L -> 1

Example:
```
L:
  S <- {0, 1}^lambda
  guess(x):
    return x == s

A:
  repeat
    x <- {0, 1}^lambda
  until guess(x)

  return x

P[A x L = z] = 2^-lambda # For given z in K
P[A x L = S] = 1 # As searched until secret found
Running time O(2^lambda)


B:
  x <- {0, 1}^lambda
  return guess(x)

P[B x L = true] = 2^-lambda
Running time O(1)
```

#### Def: Exchangable

Two libraries L1, L2 are exchangable, written L1 =- L2 # Equivalence operator
if for all distinguishing algorithms A:

P[A x L1 = 1] = P[A x L2 = 1]

Libraries are blackbox for algorithm, also no side information exposed (eg
computational time, power consumption, electromagnetic signatures, ...)
  - Eg early smart cards leaked arithmetic operations due to power consumption

- A interacts with L only via interface
- No side-channels

##### Two libraries

```
L_eager:
  for x in X:
    T[x] <- {0, 1}^lambda

  Get(x):
    return T[x]

L_lazy:
  T[*] = nil

  Get(x):
  if T[x] = nil
    T[x] <- {0, 1}^lambda

  return T[x]
```

Both libraries are exchangable according to the definition above.

### Security definition using libraries

#### Def: Uniform ciphertext

Notation: ots$ = One-time-secret with random cipher-text

An encryption scheme Sigma has uniform ciphertexts if:

L_(ots$-real) =- L_(ots$-rand)
```
L_(ots$-real):
  CTXT(m):
    k <- KeyGen()
    c <- Enc(k, m)
    return c

L_(ots$-rand)
  CTXT(m):
    c <- C
    return c
```

#### Def: One-time secrecy

Encryption scheme Sigma has one-time secrecy if:
L_(ots-left) =- L_(ots-right)

```
L_(ots-left):
  Eavesdrop(m_l, m_r):
    k <- KeyGen()
    c <- Enc(k, m_l)
    return c

L_(ots-right):
  Eavesdrop(m_l, m_r):
    k <- KeyGen()
    c <- Enc(k, m_r)
    return c
```

Note: Way it's specified (key created in every invocation of Eavesdrop) implies
one-time keys, rather than "written in words".
