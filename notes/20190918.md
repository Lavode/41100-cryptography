# Introduction

Historical: Cryptology = Cryptography + Cryptoanalysis
These days: Cryptology == Cryptography

Cryptology concerns protection of information in adverserial context (eg public networks)


Classical goals:
  - Confidentiality
  - Integrity
  - Availability

Tools:
  - Confidentiality => Encryption
  - Integrity => Signatures, hash functions, MAC (message authentication codes)

Availability not very relevant in modern cryptography.

Modern goals:
  - Confidentiality & integrity often interwoven
  - Anonymity: Zero-knowledge proofs

## A model for a cryptosystem

- Alice (A) wants to send message (M) to Bob (B)
- Keygenerator "somewhere" produces key k = keygen(), known to Alice & Bob (key exchange handled later)
- Alice encodes m, encoder(m, k) = c, Bob decodes c, decoder(c, k) = m^
- E gets *copy* of ciphertext c, but can not interfere with it (block, modify, ...)

KeyGen() -> k, algorithm with certain randomness (else always same key)
Enc(k, m) -> c
Dec(k, c) -> m^

Adversary's algorithm arbitrary, insofar as we want to be secure against
"everything" (excluding eg arbitrarily high computing power)
  - Any polynomial-time algorithm is ok

Goal:
  1) Completness: Bob obtains m^ = m
  2) Security: "Eve obtains no useful information about m"

These days: Security arguments required for crypto systems. Proofs from the
base up are not possible, due to eg P = NP problem.

## Historic cryptography

### Caesar cipher / shift cipher

```
KeyGen(): k <- {0, 1, ..., 25}
Enc(k, l): return (l + k) % 26
Dec(k, l): return l - k # + 26 if < 0
```

## Monoalphabetic substitution

- Generalization of shift cipher, keygen maps each input letter to one letter of the output alphabet
- Keyspace = 26! ~= 2^(88)
- Not secure for natural languages, as existing patterns lessen security

# Mathematical preliminaries

## Probability theory

- Basics as used in eg AWI

# Kerkhoff's principle

Design crypto system such that its security does not rely on the secrecy of the
cryptosystem's algorithm itself.

Allows specifying key separately, to eg study algorithm in public, allow easier
reuse of system, etc.

# One-time pad

Perfectly secure crypto system, as well as really inconvenient.

Key of length equal to message, key used only once. "Pad" refers to pads (piece
of paper) containing key.

Each character of message encypted with shift-offset of corresponding character
in key.

## Implementation (binary strings), Vernam cipher

Let key and message be bit strings of length l. Let Sigma := {0, 1} alphabet.

```
KeyGen():
  k <- Sigma^l
  return k

Enc(k, m):
  return k XOR m

Dec(k, c):
  return k XOR c
```

- Ciphertext will always be uniformly random
- Plaintext is perfectly hidden
- Ciphertext can be decrypted with any key, but only one key yields original plaintext

### Theorem: Completness of Vernam cipher

Forall m, k in sigma^l:
  Dec(k, Enc(k, m)) = m

Proof:
    k XOR (k XOR m)
  = (k XOR k) XOR m
  = 0^l XOR m
  = m

### Security

Consider experiment which produces exactly the distribution seen by Eve.

```
Eavesdrop(m):
  k <- sigma^l // Pick random key
  c <- m XOR k
  return c
```

#### Theorem

Forall m in sigma^l: Eavesdrop(m) is a uniform random variable over sigma^l.

In particular:
Let m, m' in sigma^l, m != m.
Eavesdrop(m) and Eavesdrop(m') follow the same distribution

Proof:
```
Forall m in sigma^l, forall c in sigma^l:

P[eavesdrop(m) = c] = ?

We know:
c = m XOR k <=> k = m XOR c

Now:
P[eavesdrop(m) = c] = P[m XOR k = c] = P[k = m XOR c]
Let s := m XOR c
  = P[k = s]
  = 2^-l

```
