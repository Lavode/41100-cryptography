# 11 RSA

RSA is first public-key cryptosystem with signatures. Compare DH: Just key
exchange. ElGamal: Just encryption.

RSA is deterministic - not suitable for direct usage, as not CPA-secure.

Recall DLP:
- Cyclic group G with known number of elements. In RSA this is part of the
  secret.
- G subset `Z^*_p`, |G| = q, q prime

What if we compute modulo a composite m?
- Computing modulo m: Add, subtract, multiply easily possible (a . b mod m)
  - Division requires finding inverse.
      Inverse of x: y such that x * y =-_m 1
- Compute inverse by restricting Z_m to `Z^*_m := {a in Z_m : gcd(a, m) = 1 }`
  Can then compute inverse using extended Euclidian algorithm:
    `egcd(a, b) -> (g, s, t)`
    - g = gcd(a, b)
    - g = s * a + t * b
- Suppose `egcd(a, m) -> (g, s, t)`
  then: `1 = s * a + t * m IFF s * a =-_m 1`

What if `gcd(a, m) > 1`?
- One factor of m = pq would then be known, which conflicts with assumptions
  that m is hard to factor. Hence negligible probability to find such a factor.

## Def Euler (Phi) function

`Phi: Z+ -> Z+, m -> |Z^*m| = |{a in Z_m : gcd(a, m) = 1 }|`

Number of factors in `Z_m` which are coprime to m. (`gcd(a, m) = 1`)

- phi(p) = p - 1, for p prime (all exclusive 1)
- phi(6) = 2
- phi(15) = 8

## Theorem

Let `m = p_1^e_1 ... p_n^e_n, p_i prime`
Then `phi(m) = prod_i=1^n (p_i - 1) * p_i^{e_i - 1}`

### Proof

Let `m = pq` prime. Then `phi(m) = pq - q - p + 1 = (p - 1)(q - 1)`
(`pq` numbers, every q-th is a factor of q, every p-th is a factor of p, `1`
subtracted twice)

## Theorem

`Forall z in Z^*_m: a^(phi(m)) =-_m 1`

It seems the only way to compute phi(m) is to factor m. Basis of security with
RSA.

## RSA function

```
KeyGen() -> (pk, sk)
Eval(pk, x) -> y
Invert(sk, y) -> x'
```

"Trapdoor" one-way function. Forward direction easy, second direction easy if
secret key known, hard otherwise.

```
KeyGen():
  # Lambda on order of 1000 bits these days
  p <- PRIMES(lambda) # Primes of lambda bit length
  q <- PRIMES(lambda)

  N := pq

  e <- PRIMES(lambda) # e can also be a fixed 'small' prime (smaller than lambda)
  d := e^-1 mod phi(N) # e * d =_phi(N) 1

  return ((N, e), d)

Eval((N, e), x):
  return x^e mod N

Invert(d, y):
  return y^d mod N
```

### Completness

Let `((N, e), d) := KeyGen()`. For `x in Z^*_N: Invert(d, Eval((N, e), x)) = x`

```
y^d
= (x^e)^d
= x^(ed)
= x^(k * phi(N) +1) # Exists k
=-_N x # Euler's theorem
```

### Security

Factoring seems to be difficult, decades of research have failed to find an
efficient algorithm.

Formally: Factoring in NP (polynomial time verification, nopolynomial time
solution) and co-NP (inversion is in NP).

### Assumption

RSA security if two libraries are indistinguishable.

```
L_RSA-real:
  ((N, e), d) := KeyGen()
  C := {}

  GETKEY():
    return (N, e)

  GETRAND():
    c <- Z_N
    C << c

    return c

  TEST(x, c):
    if c not in C:
      return false

    if x^e =-_N c:
      return true
    else:
      return false

L_RSA-fake:
# Identical, except:
  TEST(x, c):
    return false
```

Restricting choices of c prevents adversary from maufacturing one value (based
on the pk) which would allow to distinguish.

### Textbook RSA encryption

```
(pk, sk) <- KeyGen()
Enc(pk, m) = Eval(pk, m)
Dec(sk, c) = Invert(sk, c)
```

Not CPA-secure as deterministic, consider distinguisher: `return TEST(0, 0) == TEST(0, 1)`.
Any kind of this implementation would also not be CCA-secure, see
Bleichenbacher attack.


*PS*: Any kind of deterministic encryption is not CPA-secure.

### Secure encryption with RSA, with random oracle (RO)

```
KeyGen() # as in RSA, pk additionally contains hash function H: Z_N -> {0, 1}^k

Encrypt((N, e), m):
  r <- Z_N
  R := r^e mod N # = Eval((N, e), r)
  C := H(r) XOR m
  return (R, C)

Decrypt(sk, (R, C)):
  r := Invert(sk, R)
  m := H(r) XOR C
  return m
```

NB: We use a random oracle H, rather than eg directly multiplying with the
random value `r`, to break any possible structure.

In practice: OAEP with RSA (optimal asymmetric encryption padding). Advantage over
random oracle: Only one 2k bit component from which two extract message, rather
than two (R and C)

Why secure?
- RSA function only applied to randomly choisen values in `Z_N`
- Decoupled RSA function from message m using the RO H
- Formal security: Katz-Lindell, 11.5.5 in book

### Random self-reductions

- Are some instances of a problem easier to break than others?
- Or is inverting RSA (eg) harder on some c than on other values c?

RSR shows that the worst case is not more difficult than breaking the average
case. RSR turns an algorithm which solves the problem in the average case into
one which solves the problem in the worst case, (with only a constant factor).

Suppose there is `A^*(c)` (for random c) outputs x such that `TEST(x, c) ->
TRUE` with probability delta (const).
Then there is a `B(c)` that outputs x such that `TEST(x, c) -> TRUE` with
probability 1.
```
B(c):
  (N, e) <- KeyGen()
  repeat
    r <- Z_N
    c' := r^e * c
    x' := A^*(c') # correct with probability delta, that is x'^e =-_N c'
    x := x' * r^-1 mod N
  until x^e =-_N c

  return x
```

`B(c)` always yields correct response, and only 'constant' (merely depending on
delta) difference in effort.

NB: RSR is an indication that a problem is *good* for security, as it implies
that it's secure on average - eg no special consideration for to-be-encrypted
message needed.

Similar RSR exist also for DDHP, DLP, CDHP.
