# Pseudorandom generator

A pseudorandom generator (PRG) is a deterministic function which:
- Stretches a short truly random input (seed) to a long sequence of *pseudorandom* bits
- Directly gives a *stream cipher*
- Is perhaps the most basic tool of cryptography

## Def PRG

A PRG is a deterministic function G: {0, 1}^lambda -> {0, 1}^(lambda+l) which satisfies:
L_(prg-real) ~~~ L_(prg-rand), where

```
L_(prg-real):
  query():
    s <- {0, 1}^lambda
    return G(s)

L_(prg-rand):
  query():
    r <- {0, 1}^(lambda+l)
    return r
```

### Ex

A length-doubling PRG G:{0,1}^lambda -> {0,1}^(2 lambda)
|dom(G)| = 2^lambda (# Input strings)
|range(G)| leq 2^lambda (# Output strings)
If G injective: |range(G) = 2^lambda

But output stretches bigger range of values.

##

Even if G(s) for random `s<-{0,1}^lambda` outputs only small subset of
`{0,1}^(2 lambda)`, no efficient (polynomial deterministic) algorithm can
distinguish G(s) from truly random 2lambda-bit string.

## Ex linear congruential generator

Java's java.util.random:
```
s0 := seed
s1 = (s_i * a + c) mod n
```

*Not* cryptographically secure, looks random but completely determinable.

## Stream cipher - Enryption from PRG (5.6 in script)

- A stream cipher performs encryption like the OTP, but:
  - it uses a short key
  - with (only) computational/conditional security

- Prototype for a symmetric cryptosystem; in practice also the fastest

### Remark

- Encryption and decryption are stateful, need to keep track of where they are at.
- Requires that PRG outputs key stream in small pieces
- This stream cipher offers no integrity/message authenticity, cipher is
  malleable
  => Cipher bits can be changed at random, causing corresponding output bits to
     be flipped, with no indication it happened.
     Practice: MAC (message authentication code) complements stream cipher, provides authenticity

## Def Computational one-time secrecy

An encryption scheme sigma = (KeyGen, Enc, Dec) has computational secrecy if
L^Sigma_(OTS-L) ~~~ L^Sigma_(OTS-R)

Left/Right libraries according to common defintion.

Computational security, so indistingishuability sufficient, other than OTS
which requires interchangability.

Stream cipher S using a PRG G
```
K = {0, 1}^lambda
M = {0, 1}^(lambda + l)
C = {0, 1}^(lambda + l)

KeyGen()
  k <- K
  return k

Enc(k, m):
  return G(k) XOR m

Dec(k, c):
  return G(k) XOR c
```

## Theorem

If G is a secure PRG, then a stream cipher S has computational one-time secrecy
if L^Sigma_(OTS-L) ~~~ L^Sigma_(OTS-R)

### Proof

```
L^S_(OTS-L):
  Eavesdrop(m_l, m_r):
    k <- S.KeyGen()
    c := S.Enc(k, m_l)
    return c

Hyb_1 (Interchangable, simply KeyGen() and Enc() inlined):
  Eavesdrop(m_l, m_r):
    k <- {0, 1}^lambda
    c := G(k) XOR m_l
    return c

Hyb_2 (Interchangable, new variable, XOR is commutative)
  Eavesdrop(m_l, m_r):
    k <- {0, 1}^lambda
    z := G(k)
    return m_l XOR z

Hyb_3 (Indistinguishable as PRG computationally secure)
  Eavesdrop(m_l, m_r):
    z <- {0, 1}^(lambda + l)
    return m_l XOR z

Hyb_4 (Exchangable, as this is OTP which provides a uniform output / has OTS)
  Eavesdrop(m_l, m_r):
    z <- {0, 1}^(lambda + l)
    return m_r XOR z

Hyb_5 (Indistinguishable as PRG computationally secure)
  Eavesdrop(m_l, m_r):
    k <- {0, 1}^lambda
    z := G(k)
    return m_r XOR z

Hyb_6 (Interchangable, one fewer variable, XOR is commutative)
  Eavesdrop(m_l, m_r):
    k <- {0, 1}^lambda
    return G(k) XOR m_r

L^S_(OTS-L) (pulling definitions out again):
  Eavesdrop(m_l, m_r):
    k <- S.KeyGen()
    c := S.Enc(k, m_r)
    return c
```

Hence two libraries indistinguishable, stream cipher S has computational
security.

## Extending the stretch of a PRG (5.5 in script)

Goal: PRG which can be stretched arbitrarily. H: {0, 1}^lambda -> {0, 1}^((n +
1) * lambda), given doubling PRG G.

Idea: Take output of G, split in two blocks, feed each block into G, rinse &
repeat.

```
H_n(s in {0, 1}^lambda):
  s0 := s
  for i = 1 .. n do:
    t_i || s_i := G(s_(i-1)) # Split output in two

  return t_1 || ... || t_n || s_n
```
